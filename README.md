Game using the Pygame library where players improve their mouse aiming skills by targeting dynamically growing and shrinking circles. The game features targets that appear at random positions on the screen at regular intervals and players must click them before they disappear or shrink to nothing. The interface provides real-time updates on the player's performance, including time elapsed, speed of hitting targets, hits, and misses, as well as calculating the accuracy percentage based on successful hits versus total clicks. The game ends if the player loses all allocated lives due to missing targets. The code includes functionalities for initializing the game environment, handling events, updating target states, and rendering the game graphics.
